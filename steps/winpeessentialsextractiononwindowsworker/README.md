This Blueprint extracts the essential files require for the WinPE 
(Windows Preinstallation Environment). 
The steps are performed on a Windows system using PowerShell commands.

The WinPE files are extracted from a Windows Server 2019 ISO 
and repackaged into a WinPE ISO. The WinPE ISO is reused to 
create bootable ISO files for various Windows distributions.

This extracted files work for both BIOS and UEFI boot methods.
