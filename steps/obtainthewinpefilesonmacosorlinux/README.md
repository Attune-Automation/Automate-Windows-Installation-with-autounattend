This Blueprint obtains the WinPE (Windows Preinstallation Environment) 
files on a Linux or macOS system using bash commands.

The WinPE files are extracted from a Windows Server 2019 ISO 
and repackaged into a WinPE ISO. The WinPE ISO is reused to 
create bootable ISO files for various Windows distributions.
